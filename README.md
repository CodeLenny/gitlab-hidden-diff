# GitLab Hidden Diff
Hides diffs in merge requests according to user-defined wildcards.


## Installation

With [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) installed in your browser,
visit the [Raw Script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeLenny/gitlab-links/master/diff-hider.user.js),
which TamperMonkey will prompt you to install.

The script is set to automatically update itself, but the TamperMonkey extension has a very slow update interval by
default.  I recommend adjusting the update frequency in the TamperMonkey settings.

## Settings

Visit [codelenny.gitlab.io/gitlab-hidden-diff](http://codelenny.gitlab.io/gitlab-hidden-diff/) to configure the plugin.
